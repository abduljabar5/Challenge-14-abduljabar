## Discription
This project was very challenging, yet incredibly fun. What kept me motivated was the opportunity to overcome new obstacles and complete the project successfully. The primary objective of this project was to develop a CMS-style blog site, similar to a Wordpress site, that enables developers to publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts. To accomplish this, I configured a working Express.js API that interacted with a MySQL database using Sequelize. Throughout the project, I gained a deeper understanding of SQL and learned new techniques for implementing effective database solutions. Overall, this project provided me with valuable experience and expanded my skill set, equipping me to tackle similar challenges in the future.
